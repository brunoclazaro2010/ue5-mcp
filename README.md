## 📋 What is ue5-mcp?

ue5-mcp is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that helps you change your Blueprints with the help of AI. Instead of learning complex coding or scripting in Unreal, you just tell the AI what you want in plain English. The AI will then edit your Blueprints for you.

This plugin uses the Model-Context Protocol (MCP) to connect to Claude Code, a powerful AI model. It understands your instructions and makes the changes you describe. Whether you want to add new game features, fix bugs, or tweak behaviors, ue5-mcp simplifies the process.
